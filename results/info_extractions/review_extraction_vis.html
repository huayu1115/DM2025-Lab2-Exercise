Zootopia 
Fantasy films aimed at kids don’t have to have political messages, but when they 
do, they should either be internally consistent, or work through the 
contradictions in terms that kids can apply to the real world. “Zootopia,” a 
fantasy set in a city where predators and prey live together in harmony, is <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a funny, 
beautifully designed kids’ film</span> with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a message that it restates at every turn</span>. But if 
you think about that message for longer than five minutes, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it doesn’t merely fall 
apart</span>, it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">invites a reading that is almost surely contrary to the movie’s seemingly 
enlightened spirit</span>: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">discrimination is wrong</span>, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">stereotypes are stereotypes for a 
reason</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it’s not easy for members of a despised class to overcome the 
reasons why the majority despises them</span>, so <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">you gotta be patient</span>. 
Ginnifer Goodwin (“Big Love”) voices Bunny Hops, a small town rabbit who’s told 
that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">she can’t be a police officer</span> in Zootopia because <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">there’s never been a rabbit 
police officer</span>. (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The job tends to be done by predators and large herbivores</span>—like a 
water buffalo that’s become a police captain, voiced by Idris Elba.) <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Hops makes 
it through police training anyway</span> and gets <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">assigned to meter maid duty</span>, to the 
relief of her carrot farmer parents (Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake), who gave her fox 
repellent as a going-away present. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">They had good reason to give her fox 
repellent</span>: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the fox is one of the rabbit’s mortal enemies</span>, and when Judy was child, 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a fox cornered her at a county fair, insulted her for being a bunny, and slashed her 
face with his paw</span>. (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">This is a slightly more intense kid-flick than you might expect</span>, 
given how many adorable animals are in it.) 
Of course Hops ends up partnered with a red fox named Nick Wilde (Jason 
Bateman), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a small-time hustler</span> who <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">reluctantly helps her investigate the 
disappearances of a dozen predators</span>. I won’t reveal exactly what the mystery is 
here (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it’s a pretty good one</span>) except to say that it invites kids and parents to talk 
about nature versus nurture, and the origins and debilitating effect of 
stereotypes. 
But <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">this turns out to be not such a great thing</span> once you get deeper into the movie. 
Because people are not animals, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I dread thinking about the “logical” conclusions 
to which such conversations will lead</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The film isn’t wrong to say that carnivores 
are biologically inclined to want to eat herbivores, that bunnies reproduce</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
prolifically, the sloths are slow-moving (they work at the DMV here), that you can 
take the fox out of the forest but you can’t take forest out of the fox, and so on. If 
you think about all this as an analogy for the world we live in (particularly if we 
live in a melting-pot big city like Zootopia) and and then ask yourself which racial 
or ethnic or societal groups (cops, businesspeople, city bureaucrats) are 
“predators” and which are “prey” (for purposes of metaphor translation), you see 
the problem. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">“Zootopia” pretty much rubber-stamps whatever worldview parents 
want to pass on to their kids, however embracing or malignant that may be.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I can 
imagine an anti-racist and a racist coming out of this film, each thinking it 
validated their sense of how the world works.</span> 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">“Zootopia” is constantly asking its characters to look past species stereotypes, 
and not use species-ist language or repeat hurtful assumptions.</span> “Only a bunny 
can call another bunny ‘cute,’” Hops warns a colleague <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It’s filled with moments 
that are about overcoming or enduring discrimination.</span> “Never let them see that 
they get to you,” Wilde advises Hops. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">And there are acknowledgments of the 
destructive self-hatred that discrimination can cause.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Many of the animals make 
self-deprecating jokes at the expense of stereotypes about their species</span> (such as 
Hops volunteering to do math for Wilde, telling him, “If there’s one thing we 
bunnies are good at, it’s multiplying”), and there’s a fairly intense flashback 
which reveals that Wilde became a hustler because other animals hazed him as 
a pup while repeating anti-fox stereotypes, and responded by embracing his 
species’ caricature and becoming the foxiest fox anyone had seen. This all 
seems clever and noble until you realize that all the stereotypes about various 
animals are to some extent true, in particular the most basic one: carnivores eat 
herbivores because it’s in their nature. (Yes, readers, I know, there are tigers 
who’ve been taught to snuggle with lambs, and I’ve seen the same memes with 
cats and dogs snuggling that you have; I mean in general.) 
It might seem weird that I’m dwelling on this aspect of “Zootopia,” which is 
directed by Byron Howard &amp; Rich Moore and co-directed by Jared Bush, because 
the movie is entertaining. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The thriller plot, which borrows rather generously from 
“48 HRS” and every cop drama involving governmental conspiracy, is smartly 
shaped</span>  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">It’s hard to imagine any child or adult failing to be amused and excited</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 3**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
by parts of it. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The compositions and lighting are more thoughtful than you tend to 
get in a 3-D animated film starring big-eyed animals who speak with the voices of 
celebrities.</span> And <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">there are a few sections that are transportingly lovely</span>, in 
particular any sequence involving the pop star Gazelle (voiced by Shakira), and 
Hops’ high-speed train ride towards and through Zootopia, which introduces the 
city’s different terrains (including frozen tundra and misty rainforest) while 
leaving room for subsequent bits of spelunking (a foot chase through rodent 
town lets Hops know what it feels like to be a giant). Some of the biggest laughs 
come from obvious gags that you know the writers couldn’t resist, such as the bit 
where Idris’ water buffalo captain says they can’t start the morning briefing 
without acknowledging the elephant in the room. If you decide not to think about 
the metaphor that the film is built around, it’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an enjoyable diversion</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">made with 
great skill</span>. 
Still: is it too much to ask that a film that wears its noble intentions like a jangling 
neck collar be able to withstand scrutiny? If “Zootopia” were <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a bit vaguer, or 
perhaps dumber and less pleased with itself</span>, it might have been a classic, albeit 
of a very different, less reputable sort. As-is, it’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a goodhearted, handsomely 
executed film</span> that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">doesn’t add up in the way it wants to</span>.
