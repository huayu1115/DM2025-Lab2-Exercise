have political messages, but when they \ndo, they should either be internally consistent, or work through the \ncontradictions in terms that kids can apply to the real world. “Zootopia,” a \nfantasy set in a city where predators and prey live together in harmony, is a funny, \nbeautifully designed kids’ film with a message that it restates at every turn. But if \nyou think about that message for longer than five minutes, it doesn’t merely fall \napart, it invites a reading that is almost surely contrary to the movie’s seemingly \nenlightened spirit: discrimination is wrong, but stereotypes are stereotypes for a \nreason, and it’s not easy for members of a despised class to overcome the \nreasons why the majority despises them, so you gotta be patient. \nGinnifer Goodwin (“Big Love”) voices Bunny Hops, a small town rabbit who’s told \nthat she can’t be a police officer in Zootopia because there’s never been a rabbit \npolice officer. (The job tends to be done by predators and large herbivores—like a \nwater buffalo that’s become a police captain, voiced by Idris Elba.) Hops makes \nit through police training anyway and gets assigned to meter maid duty, to the \nrelief of her carrot farmer parents (Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake), who gave her fox \nrepellent as a going-away present. They had good reason to give her fox \nrepellent: the fox is one of the rabbit’s mortal enemies, and when Judy was child, \na fox cornered her at a county fair, insulted her for being a bunny, and slashed her \nface with his paw. (This is a slightly more intense kid-flick than you might expect, \ngiven how many adorable animals are in it.) \nOf course Hops ends up partnered with a red fox named Nick Wilde (Jason \nBateman), a small-time hustler who reluctantly helps her investigate the \ndisappearances of a dozen predators. I won’t reveal exactly what the mystery is \nhere (it’s a pretty good one) except to say that it invites kids and parents to talk \nabout nature versus nurture, and the origins and debilitating effect of \nstereotypes. \nBut this turns out to be not such a great thing once you get deeper into the movie. \nBecause people are not animals, I dread thinking about the “logical” conclusions \nto which such conversations will lead. The film isn’t wrong to say that carnivores \nare biologically inclined to want to eat herbivores, that bunnies reproduce\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nprolifically, the sloths are slow-moving (they work at the DMV here), that you can \ntake the fox out of the forest but you can’t take forest out of the fox, and so on. If \nyou think about all this as an analogy for the world we live in (particularly if we \nlive in a melting-pot big city like Zootopia) and and then ask yourself which racial \nor ethnic or societal groups (cops, businesspeople, city bureaucrats) are \n“predators” and which are “prey” (for purposes of metaphor translation), you see \nthe problem. “Zootopia” pretty much rubber-stamps whatever worldview parents \nwant to pass on to their kids, however embracing or malignant that may be. I can \nimagine an anti-racist and a racist coming out of this film, each thinking it \nvalidated their sense of how the world works. \n“Zootopia” is constantly asking its characters to look past species stereotypes, \nand not use species-ist language or repeat hurtful assumptions. “Only a bunny \ncan call another bunny ‘cute,’” Hops warns a colleague It’s filled with moments \nthat are about overcoming or enduring discrimination. “Never let them see that \nthey get to you,” Wilde advises Hops. And there are acknowledgments of the \ndestructive self-hatred that discrimination can cause. Many of the animals make \nself-deprecating jokes at the expense of stereotypes about their species (such as \nHops volunteering to do math for Wilde, telling him, “If there’s one thing we \nbunnies are good at, it’s multiplying”), and there’s a fairly intense flashback \nwhich reveals that Wilde became a hustler because other animals hazed him as \na pup while repeating anti-fox stereotypes, and responded by embracing his \nspecies’ caricature and becoming the foxiest fox anyone had seen. This all \nseems clever and noble until you realize that all the stereotypes about various \nanimals are to some extent true, in particular the most basic one: carnivores eat \nherbivores because it’s in their nature. (Yes, readers, I know, there are tigers \nwho’ve been taught to snuggle with lambs, and I’ve seen the same memes with \ncats and dogs snuggling that you have; I mean in general.) \nIt might seem weird that I’m dwelling on this aspect of “Zootopia,” which is \ndirected by Byron Howard & Rich Moore and co-directed by Jared Bush, because \nthe movie is entertaining. The thriller plot, which borrows rather generously from \n“48 HRS” and every cop drama involving governmental conspiracy, is smartly \nshaped  It’s hard to imagine any child or adult failing to be amused and excited\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 3**\n\"\"\"\nby parts of it. The compositions and lighting are more thoughtful than you tend to \nget in a 3-D animated film starring big-eyed animals who speak with the voices of \ncelebrities. And there are a few sections that are transportingly lovely, in \nparticular any sequence involving the pop star Gazelle (voiced by Shakira), and \nHops’ high-speed train ride towards and through Zootopia, which introduces the \ncity’s different terrains (including frozen tundra and misty rainforest) while \nleaving room for subsequent bits of spelunking (a foot chase through rodent \ntown lets Hops know what it feels like to be a giant). Some of the biggest laughs \ncome from obvious gags that you know the writers couldn’t resist, such as the bit \nwhere Idris’ water buffalo captain says they can’t start the morning briefing \nwithout acknowledging the elephant in the room. If you decide not to think about \nthe metaphor that the film is built around, it’s an enjoyable diversion, made with \ngreat skill. \nStill: is it too much to ask that a film that wears its noble intentions like a jangling \nneck collar be able to withstand scrutiny? If “Zootopia” were a bit vaguer, or \nperhaps dumber and less pleased with itself, it might have been a classic, albeit \nof a very different, less reputable sort. As-is, it’s a goodhearted, handsomely \nexecuted film that doesn’t add up in the way it wants to.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_988a8e87"}
